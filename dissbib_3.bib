  abstract = {The word `attosecond' (1 as = 10-18 s) officially entered the vocabulary of physics when sub-femtosecond pulses of UV/XUV light produced either by nonlinear frequency conversion of a ultra-short infrared pump pulse or Fourier synthesis of broad bandwidth radiation were established. The physics of these pulses is based on nonlinear, nonperturbative laser\textendash atom interaction: stimulated Raman scattering or high harmonic generation (HHG) is used to generate the necessary bandwidth, which naturally encompasses the visible and UV/XUV spectral range. However, the crucial element for attosecond pulse generation is the control of the spectral phase. New methods of temporal characterization at frequencies lying in the UV/XUV had to be elaborated. These methods rely on the energy/momentum analysis of photoelectrons produced by XUV attosecond flashes in the presence of an intense infrared field whose optical cycle itself becomes the basic clock. Single 650 as pulses have been produced and applied to trace the dynamics of electrons inside atoms following the creation of an inner-shell hole. Periodic combs of 250 as pulses have been synthesized by superposing just four harmonics and applying to the attosecond timing of the electron motion in HHG. Although it is easy to increase the bandwidth by coupling more harmonics, a fundamental limit to the duration of the light bursts produced has been discovered. It is imposed by the lack of synchronization of the different harmonic orders. The current limit is estimated to be 130 as. The latest advances include a direct autocorrelation of an attosecond pulse train and the production of a single 250 as soft x-ray pulse. This paper offers a snapshot of the state-ofthe-art in the production and characterization of attosecond light pulses, with a glimpse at the first steps in attophysics.},

As a result, a phase lookup table is determined that can be used for any situation where a first-order (blazed) diffractive element is modified to produce higher orders with desired intensity and/or phase relation. As examples, we demonstrate the phase difference control on triplicators, as well as on other generalized diffractive elements like bifocal Fresnel lenses and phase masks for the generation of vortex beams.

Recent measurements of the attosecond transient absorption spectrum (ATAS) of helium dressed by a few-cycle visible pulse [C. Ott et al., Nature (London) 516, 374 (2014)] provide evidence of the inversion of Fano profiles. With the support of accurate ab initio calculations that reproduce the results of the latter experiment, here we investigate the new physics that arise from ATAS when the laser intensity is increased. In particular, we show that (i) previously unnoticed signatures of the dark 2p21S doubly excited state are observed in the experimental spectrum, (ii) inversion of Fano profiles is predicted to be periodic in the laser intensity, and (iii) the ac Stark shift of the higher terms in the sp+2,n autoionizing series exceeds the ponderomotive energy, which is the result of a genuine two-electron contribution to the polarization of the excited atom.},

  abstract = {X-ray vision catches Woodward-Hoffmann
The celebrated Woodward-Hoffmann (W-H) rules rationalize a variety of rapid bond rearrangements in organic molecules. The key insight involved symmetry conservation in the electronic journey from reactant to product. Attar et al. now report femtosecond x-ray absorption spectra and accompanying simulation studies that track shifts in carbon electronic states during one such reaction: the photochemical ring opening of cyclohexadiene to hexatriene (see the Perspective by Sension). The smooth evolution that occurs in the vicinity of the pericyclic minimum provides direct affirmation of the W-H framework. Moreover, the use of a convenient tabletop apparatus bodes well for future x-ray studies of ultrafast electronic dynamics.
Science, this issue p. 54; see also p. 31
The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (\textasciitilde 284 electron volts) on a tabletop apparatus to directly reveal the valence electronic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital energy levels. We show that this transient valence electronic structure arises within 60 {$\pm$} 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 {$\pm$} 60 fs.
X-rays reveal the rapidly evolving electronic structure of carbons rearranging from cyclohexadiene to acyclic hexatriene.

In the latter regime, the attosecond pulse first interacts with a sample, then the observed absorption features are modified by a NIR pulse, which interacts with the sample well after the attosecond pulse has passed. In these experiments, which seem counterintuitive when compared to conventional transient absorption spectroscopy, the weak attosecond pulse induces a polarization of the medium, which is then perturbed by the time-delayed NIR pulse.

The time-delay-dependent transient-absorption spectrum of an intense probe pulse is thus predicted, simulating pump-probe experiments in which this is preceded or followed by a strong pump pulse. Numerical results are interpreted in terms of an analytical model based on interaction operators, which quantify the transformation undergone by the system under the action of an intense pulse. The oscillating features of the resulting transient-absorption spectra, due to the coupling of several excited states, are thus interpreted in terms of the atomic population and phase changes imposed by the pump and probe pulses. Strong-field-induced phases and their influence on the resulting transient-absorption spectra are thereby investigated for different values of pump and probe intensities and frequencies, focusing on the atomic properties which are encoded in the absorption line shapes for positive and negative time delays.},

Femtosecond transient absorption on iron and cobalt oxides identifies ligand-to-metal charge transfer as the main spectroscopic transition, rather than metal-to-metal charge transfer or d\textendash d transitions, upon photoexcitation in the visible. In silicon, attosecond transient absorption reveals that electrons tunnel into the conduction band from the valence band under strong-field excitation, to energies as high as 6~eV above the conduction band minimum. Extensions of these experiments to other semiconductors, such as germanium, and other transition metal oxides, such as vanadium dioxide, are discussed. Germanium is of particular interest because it should be possible to follow both electron and hole dynamics in a single measurement using transient XUV absorption.},

An isolated attosecond VUV pulse populates Rydberg states lying 15 eV above the argon ground state. A synchronized few-cycle near infrared (NIR) pulse modifies the oscillating dipoles of argon impulsively, leading to alterations in the VUV absorption spectra. As the NIR pulse is delayed with respect to the VUV pulse, multiple features in the absorption profile emerge simultaneously including line broadening, sideband structure, sub-cycle fast modulations, and 5\textendash 10 fs slow modulations. These features indicate the coexistence of two general processes of the light\textendash matter interaction: the energy shift of individual atomic levels and coherent population transfer between atomic eigenstates, revealing coherent superpositions. An intuitive formula is derived to treat both effects in a unifying framework, allowing one to identify and quantify the two processes in a single absorption spectrogram.},

In this implementation, the general many-electron problem can be tackled thanks to the use of the atsp2k libraries [C. Froese Fischer et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 176, 559 (2007)]. In the present contribution, we combine this method with exterior complex scaling, thereby allowing for the computation of the complex partial amplitudes that encode the whole dynamics of the photoionization process. The method is validated on the 3s3p6np series of resonances converging to the 3s extraction. Then, it is used for computing the energy dependent differential atomic delay between 3p and 3s photoemission, and agreement is found with the measurements of Gu\'enot et al. [Phys. Rev. A 85, 053424 (2012)]. The effect of the presence of resonances in the one-photon spectrum on photoionization delay measurements is studied.},

  abstract = {Small polaron formation is known to limit ground-state mobilities in metal oxide photocatalysts. However, the role of small polaron formation in the photoexcited state and how this affects the photoconversion efficiency has yet to be determined. Here, transient femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet measurements suggest that small polaron localization is responsible for the ultrafast trapping of photoexcited carriers in haematite ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3). Small polaron formation is evidenced by a sub-100 fs splitting of the Fe 3p core orbitals in the Fe M2,3 edge. The small polaron formation kinetics reproduces the triple-exponential relaxation frequently attributed to trap states. However, the measured spectral signature resembles only the spectral predictions of a small polaron and not the pre-edge features expected for mid-gap trap states. The small polaron formation probability, hopping radius and lifetime varies with excitation wavelength, decreasing with increasing energy in the t2g conduction band. The excitation-wavelength-dependent localization of carriers by small polaron formation is potentially a limiting factor in haematite's photoconversion efficiency.},

Employing transitions in the vicinity of the iron 3p (M2,3) edge, the dissociation is monitored from the point of view of the iron atom. With low strong field pump intensities ({$\approx$}2 \texttimes{} 1013 W cm\textendash 2), only ferrocenium cations are produced, and their iron 3p absorption spectrum is reported. It very closely resembles the 3p spectrum of atomic Fe+ ions but is red-shifted by 0.8 eV. With the aid of time-dependent density functional theory calculations, the spectrum is assigned to a combination of doublet and quartet spin states of ferrocenium ions. Ionization with more intense strong field pump pulses ({$\geq$}6 \texttimes{} 1013 W cm\textendash 2) leads predominantly to the prompt production of ferrocenium ions that dissociate to give the spectral signature of bare Fe+ ions within 240 {$\pm$} 80 fs. Within the temporal resolution of the experiment ({$\approx$}40 fs), no spectral intermediates are observed, suggesting that the dissociation process occurs directly from the excited ferrocenium ion and that the bonds between the iron center and both cyclopentadienyl rings are broken almost simultaneously in an asynchronous concerted decay process. No evidence of slower dissociation channels is observed at a pump\textendash probe delay of 250 ps, suggesting that all energy is very rapidly routed into dissociative states.},

The major elimination products are bromine atoms in charge states of 0, +1, and +2. The charge state distribution is strongly dependent on the incident NIR intensity. While the yield of neutral fragments is essentially constant for all measurements, charged fragment yields grow rapidly with increasing NIR intensities with the most pronounced effect observed for Br++. However, the appearance times of all bromine fragments are independent of the incident field strength; these are found to be 320 fs, 70 fs, and 30 fs for Br\textperiodcentered, Br+, and Br++, respectively. Transient molecular ion features assigned to DBE+ and DBE++ are observed, with dynamics linked to the production of Br+ products. Neutral Br\textperiodcentered{} atoms are produced on a timescale consistent with dissociation of DBE+ ions on a shallow potential energy surface. The appearance of Br+ ions by dissociative ionization is also seen, as evidenced by the simultaneous decay of a DBE+ ionic species. Dicationic Br++ products emerge within the instrument response time, presumably from Coulomb explosion of triply charged DBE.},

Theoretical analysis indicates that these light-induced structures (LISs) are the intermediate states in resonant, second-order processes that transfer population to multiple dipole forbidden states. The use of broadband, coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation allows observation of these LISs without specifically tuning to a two-photon resonance, as would be required with narrowband XUV light.

Given that the absorption spectrum results from a time-integrated measurement, we investigate the extent to which the delay dependence of the absorption yields information about the attosecond dynamics of the atom-field energy exchange. We find two configurations in which this is possible. The first involves multiphoton transitions between bound states that result in interference between different excitation pathways. The second involves the modification of the bound state absorption lines by the IR field, which we find can result in a subcycle time dependence only when ionization limits the duration of the strong-field interaction.},

We also find that the relationship between this phase variation and the group delay of the attosecond pulses depends on the intensity and wavelength of the fundamental field as well as the ionization potential of the atom.},

The degree of coherence varies with carrier-envelope phase periodically with a period of {$\pi$}. At the same time, as the harmonic orders increase, the extreme points on the curve of coherence degree vs. carrier-envelope phase shift toward the direction of carrier-envelope phase increasing. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the ionization induced frequency chirp plays an important role in the Carrier-Envelope Phase Effects on the Spatial Coherence. This effect suggests a possible method to optimize the spatial coherence of harmonics by tuning the carrier-envelope phase of the driving field.},

The technology of attosecond measurement, however, is built on established methods of characterizing femtosecond pulses: the pulse is measured after it has left the region where it was produced. We offer a completely different approach: in situ measurement. That is, we integrate attosecond-pulse production and measurement in a manner that can be applied to many high-order nonlinear interactions. To demonstrate this approach, we combine a low-intensity ({$<$}10-3) second-harmonic beam with the fundamental beam, to gently perturb the production process without significantly modifying it. The attosecond-pulse duration is read from the modulation of the even-harmonic signal as a function of the two-field delay. Increasing the second-harmonic intensity slightly ({$<$}10-2), we extend measurement to control. We demonstrate control by manipulating the high-harmonic spectrum with high efficiency.},

  abstract = {A new formulation of the theory of nuclear reactions based on the properties of a generalized ``optical'' potential is presented. The real and imaginary part of this potential satisfy a dispersion type relation while its poles give rise to resonances in nuclear reactions. A new derivation of the Breit-Wigner formula is given in which the concept of channel radius is not employed. This derivation is extended to the case of overlapping resonances. These results can then be employed to obtain the complex potential well model for pure elastic scattering. This potential well is shown to become real as the average width of the resonances increases. Reactions as well as elastic scattering are treated. Considering the former process in an isolated resonance, we obtain a nonresonant term analogous to the familiar potential scattering term of elastic scattering. This is just the direct interaction term which thus appears automatically in this formalism. Upon performing the appropriate energy averages over resonances, the complex potential well model is generalized so as to include inelastic scattering. The effects of the identity of nucleons is investigated. It is shown that our formalism is valid as long as the exit channels can at most contain one nucleon.},

  abstract = {The effective Hamiltonian method for nuclear reactions described in an earlier paper with the same title, part I, is generalized so as to include all possible reaction types, as well as the effects arising from the identity of particles. The principal device employed, as in part I, is the projection operator which selects the open channel components of the wave function. It is found that the formal structure of part I providing a unified description for direct and compound nuclear reactions including the coupled equation description for direct reactions remains valid in this wider context. A Kapur-Peierls expansion may also be readily obtained. The concept of channel radii is not needed nor is any decomposition of the wave function for the system into angular momentum eigenstates required, so that the expressions for transition amplitudes and widths are invariant with respect to the angular momentum coupling scheme. Since the open channels can only be defined in an asymptotic sense, the corresponding projection operators are not unique. As a consequence the projection operator method has a flexibility which in the first place is consonant with the wide range of phenomena which can occur in nuclear reactions and in the second place can effectively exploit an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Example of projection operators are obtained including one which leads to the Wigner-Eisenbud formalism, another which is appropriate for the stripping reaction, and, finally, one which takes the Pauli exclusion principle into account. Note that explicit representations of the projection operators are not required for the development of general formal results but are necessary if, eventually, quantitative calculations are made.},

We show that, even though the probe pulse is not assumed to be much shorter than the pump pulses, light-induced states appear in the absorption spectrum. The frequency- and time-delay-dependent features of the absorption spectra are investigated as a function of several laser control parameters, such as the number of pump pulses used, their pulse area, and the pulse-to-pulse phase shift. We show that the frequencies of the light-induced states and the time-delay-dependent features of the spectra contain information on the action of the intense pulses exciting the system, which can thus complement the information on light-imposed amplitude and phase changes encoded in the absorption line shapes.},

The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators.

The technique is first used to study the influence of ionization of the generating gas on the harmonic emission. We report a thorough study of the fringe contrast as a function of the generating parameters: gas pressure, laser intensity and focus position, harmonic order, delay, and relative intensity of the two laser pulses. We show that two phase-locked time-delayed harmonic pulses can be produced under optimal conditions. However, a strong distortion of the fringe pattern (low contrast and large asymmetry) can be induced by the deleterious effects of the medium ionization, i.e., depletion of the emitters, laser defocusing, and loss of mutual coherence that is due to free-electron dispersion. XUV frequency-domain interferometry is then applied to the measurement of the electron density of a plasma created by optical field-induced ionization of a high-pressure helium jet by use of an intense short-pulse laser. The measured temporal evolution of the electron density shows that the resolution of our experimental setup was of the order of 200 fs, which, to our knowledge, provides the first XUV interferometry measurement on a femtosecond time scale.},

Transient extreme ultraviolet reflection-absorption (XUV-RA) spectroscopy is able to follow surface electron dynamics due to its element, oxidation-state, and surface specificity, as well as the ultrafast time-resolution which can be achieved with XUV pulses produced by high harmonic generation. Here, we use ultrafast XUV-RA spectroscopy to show that charge localization and small polaron formation in Fe2O3 occur within {$\sim$}660 fs. The photoexcitation of hematite at 400 nm initially leads to an electronically-delocalized ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, which subsequently evolves into a surface localized LMCT state. Comparison of the charge carrier dynamics for single and polycrystalline samples shows that the observed dynamics are negligibly influenced by grain boundaries and surface defects. Rather, correlation between experimental results and spectral simulations reveals that the lattice expansion during small polaron formation occurs on the identical time scale as surface trapping and represents the probable driving force for sub-ps electron localization to the hematite surface.},

  abstract = {We review dispersion relations, which relate the real part of the optical susceptibility (refraction) to the imaginary part (absorption). We derive and discuss these relations as applied to nonlinear optical systems. It is shown that in the nonlinear case, for self-action effects the correct form for such dispersion relations is nondegenerate, i.e. it is necessary to use multiple frequency arguments. Nonlinear dispersion relations have been shown to be very useful as they usually only require integration over a limited frequency range (corresponding to frequencies at which the absorption changes), unlike the conventional linear Kramers-Kr\"onig relation which requires integration over all absorbing frequencies. Furthermore, calculation of refractive index changes using dispersion relations is easier than a direct calculation of the susceptibility, as transition rates (which give absorption coefficients) are, in general, far easier to calculate than the expectation value of the optical polarization. Both resonant (generation of some excitation that is long lived compared with an optical period) and nonresonant `instantaneous' optical nonlinearities are discussed, and it is shown that the nonlinear dispersion relation has a common form and can be understood in terms of the linear Kramers-Kr\"onig relation applied to a new system consisting of the material plus some `perturbation'. We present several examples of the form of this external perturbation, which can be viewed as the pump in a pump-probe experiment. We discuss the two-level saturated atom model and bandfilling in semiconductors among others for the resonant case. For the nonresonant case some recent work is included where the electronic nonlinear refractive coefficient,n2, is determined from the nonlinear absorption processes of two-photon absorption, Raman transitions and the a.c. Stark effect. We also review how the dispersion relations can be extended to give alternative forms for frequency summation which, for example, allows the real and imaginary parts of{$\chi$}(2) to be related.},

This is due to the need for a measurement system that is stable at the level of a wavelength fraction, yet allows controlled scanning of time delays. Here, we demonstrate XUV interferometry and FTS in the 17\textendash 55 nm wavelength range using an ultrastable common-path interferometer suitable for high-intensity laser pulses that drive the HHG process. This approach enables the generation of fully coherent XUV pulse pairs with sub-attosecond timing variation, tunable time delay, and a clean Gaussian spatial mode profile.

  abstract = {High harmonic generation (HHG) of an intense laser pulse is a highly nonlinear optical phenomenon that provides the only proven source of tabletop attosecond pulses, and it is the key technology in attosecond science. Recent developments in high-intensity infrared lasers have extended HHG beyond its traditional domain of the XUV spectral range (10\textendash 150\,eV) into the soft X-ray regime (150\,eV to 3\,keV), allowing the compactness, stability and sub-femtosecond duration of HHG to be combined with the atomic site specificity and electronic/structural sensitivity of X-ray spectroscopy. HHG in the soft X-ray spectral region has significant differences from HHG in the XUV, which necessitate new approaches to generating and characterizing attosecond pulses. Here, we examine the challenges and opportunities of soft X-ray HHG, and we use simulations to examine the optimal generating conditions for the development of high-flux, attosecond-duration pulses in the soft X-ray spectral range.This article is part of the theme issue `Measurement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics with X-rays'.},

  abstract = {Watching as helium goes topsy-turvy
Theorists have long pondered the underpinnings of the Fano resonance, a spectral feature that resembles adjacent rightside-up and upside-down peaks. An especially well-studied instance of this feature appears in the electronic spectrum of helium as a transient state undergoes delayed ionization. Two studies have now traced the dynamics of this state in real time. Gruson et al. used photoelectron spectroscopy to extract the amplitude and phase of the electron wave packet after inducing its interference with reference wave packets tuned into resonance at variable delays. Kaldun et al. used extreme ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy to probe the transient state while variably forcing ionization with a strong near-infrared field.
Science, this issue pp. 734 and 738
Although the time-dependent buildup of asymmetric Fano line shapes in absorption spectra has been of great theoretical interest in the past decade, experimental verification of the predictions has been elusive. Here, we report the experimental observation of the emergence of a Fano resonance in the prototype system of helium by interrupting the autoionization process of a correlated two-electron excited state with a strong laser field. The tunable temporal gate between excitation and termination of the resonance allows us to follow the formation of a Fano line shape in time. The agreement with ab initio calculations validates our experimental time-gating technique for addressing an even broader range of topics, such as the emergence of electron correlation, the onset of electron-internuclear coupling, and quasi-particle formation.

  abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient reflectivity around the germanium M4,5 edge (3d core-level to valence transition) at 30 eV is advanced to obtain the transient dielectric function of crystalline germanium [100] on femtosecond to picosecond time scales following photoexcitation by broadband visible-to-infrared (VIS/NIR) pulses. By fitting the transient dielectric function, carrier-phonon induced relaxations are extracted for the excited carrier distribution. The measurements reveal a hot electron relaxation rate of 3.2{$\pm$}0.2ps attributed to the X-L intervalley scattering and a hot hole relaxation rate of 600{$\pm$}300fs ascribed to intravalley scattering within the heavy hole (HH) band, both in good agreement with previous work. An overall energy shift of the XUV dielectric function is assigned to a thermally induced band gap shrinkage by formation of acoustic phonons, which is observed to be on a timescale of 4\textendash 5 ps, in agreement with previously measured optical phonon lifetimes. The results reveal that the transient reflectivity signal at an angle of 66{$\circ$} with respect to the surface normal is dominated by changes to the real part of the dielectric function, due to the near critical angle of incidence of the experiment (66{$\circ$}\textendash 70{$\circ$}) for the range of XUV energies used. This work provides a methodology for interpreting XUV transient reflectivity near core-level transitions, and it demonstrates the power of the XUV spectral region for measuring ultrafast excitation dynamics in solids.},

field of a strong electromagnetic wave whose frequency is lower than the ionization potential.
In the limiting case of low frequencies these expressions change into the well known formulas for the probability of tunnel auto-ionization; at high frequencies they describe processes in which several photons are absorbed simultaneously. The ionization probability has a number of resonance maxima due to intermediate transition of the atom to an excited state. In the
vicinity of such a maximum the ionization cross section increases by several orders of magnitude. The positions and widths of the resonances depend on the field strength in the wave. It is shown that for optical frequencies the mechanism under consideration, of direct ionization by the wave field, may be significant in the case of electric breakdown in gases, and especially in condensed media.},

N. Pfeiffer and S. R. Leone, Phys. Rev. A 85, 053422 (2012)]. Relevant atomic states are identified by a numerical model involving three electronic states, and the mechanism behind the broad induced absorption is discussed in the Floquet formalism.

To this end, we employ a two-stage approach based on perturbation theory, which allows us to give an analytical expression for the transient absorption signal. We focus on the situation in which the attosecond XUV pulse is used to create a coherent superposition of electronic states. As we explain, the resulting dynamics can be detected in the spectrum of the transmitted XUV pulse by manipulating the electronic wave packet using a carrier-envelope-phase-stabilized optical dressing pulse. In addition to coherent electron dynamics triggered by the attosecond pulse, the transmitted XUV spectrum encodes information on electronic states made accessible by the optical dressing pulse. We illustrate these concepts through calculations performed for a few-level model.},

  abstract = {Attosecond transient absorption spectra near the energies of autoionizing states are analyzed in terms of the photon coupling mechanisms to other states. In a recent experiment, the autoionization lifetimes of highly excited states of xenon were determined and compared to a simple expression based on a model of how quantum coherence determines the decay of a metastable state in the transient absorption spectrum. Here it is shown that this procedure for extracting lifetimes is more general and can be used in cases involving either resonant or nonresonant coupling of the attosecond-probed autoionizing state to either continua or discrete states by a time-delayed near infrared (NIR) pulse. The fits of theoretically simulated absorption signals for the 6p resonance in xenon (lifetime = 21.1 fs) to this expression yield the correct decay constant for all the coupling mechanisms considered, properly recovering the time signature of twice the autoionization lifetime due to the coherent nature of the transient absorption experiment. To distinguish between these two coupling cases, the characteristic dependencies of the transient absorption signals on both the photon energy and time delay are investigated. Additional oscillations versus delay-time in the measured spectrum are shown and quantum beat analysis is used to pinpoint the major photon-coupling mechanism induced by the NIR pulse in the current xenon experiment: the NIR pulse resonantly couples the attosecond-probed state, 6p, to an intermediate 8s (at 22.563 eV), and this 8s state is also coupled to a neighboring state (at 20.808 eV).},

Femtosecond XUV pulses covering the photon energy range of 50-72 eV probe the subsequent dynamics by measuring the time-dependent spectroscopic features associated with transitions of the Br (3d) inner-shell electrons to vacancies in molecular and atomic valence orbitals.

In particular, by analyzing the quantum evolution of the system, we interpret how atomic phases are differently encoded in the time-delay-dependent spectral absorption profiles when the pump pulse either precedes or follows the probe pulse. This scheme is experimentally applied to atomic Rb, whose fine-structure-split 5s 2S1/2\textrightarrow 5p 2P1/2 and 5s 2S1/2\textrightarrow 5p 2P3/2 transitions are driven by the combined action of a pump pulse of variable intensity and a delayed probe pulse.

  abstract = {Modern nanotechnology allows one to scale down various important devices (sensors, chips, fibers, etc.) and thus opens up new horizons for their applications. The efficiency of most of them is based on fundamental physical phenomena, such as transport of wave excitations and resonances. Short propagation distances make phase-coherent processes of waves important. Often the scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths and, as a consequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference corresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant suppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and theoretical work has revealed such patterns in different physical settings. The purpose of this review is to relate resonant scattering to Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of the main features of the Fano resonance is its asymmetric line profile. The asymmetry originates from a close coexistence of resonant transmission and resonant reflection and can be reduced to the interaction of a discrete (localized) state with a continuum of propagation modes. The basic concepts of Fano resonances are introduced, their geometrical and/or dynamical origin are explained, and theoretical and experimental studies of light propagation in photonic devices, charge transport through quantum dots, plasmon scattering in Josephson-junction networks, and matter-wave scattering in ultracold atom systems, among others are reviewed.},

  abstract = {The autocorrelation trace of an attosecond pulse train (APT) directly revealed the pulse envelope in our recent experiment on measuring the twophoton Coulomb explosion of a nitrogen molecule as a correlation signal. Although the spatial overlap of the two replicas of the APT in the correlation measurement was only achieved near the focal region owing to the spatial split of the measured APT field, which is a situation quite different from that of the correlation measurement using a Michelson interferometer, the interference fringes clearly appeared on the correlation envelope and proved the odd symmetry of the electric field to the time translation with a halfperiod of the driving laser field. In this paper, we show a simple and practical analysis for the propagation and the nonlinear interaction of an APT to simulate the experimental result of the interferometric autocorrelation of the spatially split APT. The spatial convolution of the focused electric field is essential for obtaining the fringes. We also discuss how the autocorrelation should be described in the context of the second-order perturbation theory within a dipole approximation.},

  abstract = {The long-standing scientific quest of real-time tracing electronic motion and dynamics in all states of matter has been remarkably benefited by the development of intense laser-based pulsed sources with a temporal resolution in the attosecond [1 attosecond = 10-18 s] time scale. Nowadays, attosecond pulses are routinely produced in laboratories by the synthesis of the frequency components of broadband coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation generated by the interaction of matter with intense femtosecond (fs) pulses. Attosecond pulse metrology aims at the accurate and complete determination of the temporal and phase characteristics of attosecond pulses and is one of the most innovative challenges in the broad field of ultrashort pulse metrology. For more than two decades since coherent high-brilliance broadband XUV sources have become available, fascinating advances in attosecond pulse metrology have led to the development of remarkable techniques for pulse duration measurements as well as the complete reconstruction of those pulses. Nonetheless, new challenges born from diverse fields call upon for additional efforts and continuously innovative ideas in the field. In this perspective article, we follow the history of ultrashort pulse technology tracing attosecond pulse production and characterization approaches, focus on the operation principles of the most commonly used techniques in the region where they interact with matter, address their limitations, and discuss future prospects as well as endeavors of the field to encounter contemporary scientific progress.},

  abstract = {Within this work, electron dynamics in atoms are experimentally and numerically investigated on their natural attosecond time scales. To access these dynamics, ultrashort and moderately-intense few-cycle laser pulses are superposed with attosecond pulsed radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral region. Both these sources are combined in a new experimental vacuum setup which was designed and built up from scratch, also in order to generate the attosecond pulses. Novel experimental schemes are developed which involve the temporal and spectral interferometric utilization of both ultrashort light sources and include the multidimensional spectroscopy employing different dynamical parameters. These are the intensity and the carrier-envelope phase of the laser pulses, as well as their temporal delay with respect to the attosecond pulses. Scientifically, the observation and control of the quantum-motion of bound electrons, as well as the laser-driven quasi-classical motion of free electrons was a key goal of this work. In particular, a bound two-electron wave packet in helium on attosecond time scales was experimentally observed for the first time. This was realized by combining unprecedented high temporal and spectral resolution. In addition, a new coupling mechanism of several doubly-excited states to an effective single-electron continuum is identified and analyzed. Both these two-electron states as well as single-electron states are interferometrically investigated with access to the phase of their quantum-mechanical wave function. This allows the observation and control of the quantum dynamics of two correlated electrons in atoms on the attosecond time scale which was demonstrated within the scope of this work.},

As the ligand field strength increases, the carrier mobility decreases, but the effect on the photoexcited small polaron formation is still unknown. Extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy is employed to measure small polaron formation rates and probabilities in goethite ({$\alpha$}-FeOOH) crystalline nanorods at pump photon energies from 2.2 to 3.1 eV. The measured polaron formation time increases with excitation photon energy from 70 {$\pm$} 10 fs at 2.2 eV to 350 {$\pm$} 30 fs at 2.6 eV, whereas the polaron formation probability (85 {$\pm$} 10\%) remains constant. By comparison to hematite ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3), an oxide analogue, the role of ligand composition and metal center density in small polaron formation time is discussed. This work suggests that incorporating small changes in ligands and crystal structure could enable the control of photoexcited small polaron formation in metal oxides.},

As light presents an oscillation period of a few femtoseconds (T = 2.6 fs in the near infrared spectral range), an external optical field can induce changes in a medium on the sub-cycle timescale, i.e. in a few hundred attoseconds. In this work, we resolve the dynamics of autoionizing states on the femtosecond timescale and observe the sub-cycle evolution of a coherent electronic wave packet in a diatomic molecule, exploiting a tunable ultrashort extreme ultraviolet pulse and a synchronized infrared field. The experimental observations are based on measuring the variations of the extreme ultraviolet radiation transmitted through the molecular gas. The different mechanisms contributing to the wave packet dynamics are investigated through theoretical simulations and a simple three level model. The method is general and can be extended to the investigation of more complex systems.},

  abstract = {Strong-field ionization (SFI) is a key process for accessing real-time quantum dynamics of electrons on the attosecond timescale. The theoretical foundation of SFI was pioneered in the 1960s, and later refined by various analytical models. While asymptotic ionization rates predicted by these models have been tested to be in reasonable agreement for a wide range of laser parameters, predictions for SFI on the sub-laser-cycle timescale are either beyond the scope of the models or show strong qualitative deviations from full quantum-mechanical simulations. Here, using the unprecedented state specificity of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we follow the real-time SFI process of the two valence spin\textendash orbit states of xenon. The results reveal that the irreversible tunnelling contribution is accompanied by a reversible electronic population that exhibits an observable spin\textendash orbit-dependent phase delay. A detailed theoretical analysis attributes this observation to transient ground-state polarization, an unexpected facet of SFI that cannot be captured by existing analytical models that focus exclusively on the production of asymptotic electron/ion yields.},

Recent advances in ultrafast X-ray sources operating in the femtosecond to attosecond regimes have opened an important new frontier in X-ray science. These advances now enable: (i) sensitive probing of structural dynamics in matter on the fundamental timescales of atomic motion, (ii) element-specific probing of electronic structure and charge dynamics on fundamental timescales of electronic motion, and (iii) powerful new approaches for unravelling the coupling between electronic and atomic structural dynamics that underpin the properties and function of matter. Most notable is the recent realization of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) with numerous new XFEL facilities in operation or under development worldwide. Advances in XFELs are complemented by advances in synchrotron-based and table-top laser-plasma X-ray sources now operating in the femtosecond regime, and laser-based high-order harmonic XUV sources operating in the attosecond regime.This article is part of the theme issue `Measurement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics with X-rays'.},

  abstract = {Electron transfer from valence to conduction band states in semiconductors is the basis of modern electronics. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy is used to resolve this process in silicon in real time. Electrons injected into the conduction band by few-cycle laser pulses alter the silicon XUV absorption spectrum in sharp steps synchronized with the laser electric field oscillations. The observed \textasciitilde 450-attosecond step rise time provides an upper limit for the carrier-induced band-gap reduction and the electron-electron scattering time in the conduction band. This electronic response is separated from the subsequent band-gap modifications due to lattice motion, which occurs on a time scale of 60 {$\pm$} 10 femtoseconds, characteristic of the fastest optical phonon. Quantum dynamical simulations interpret the carrier injection step as light-field\textendash induced electron tunneling.
Watching electrons dart through silicon
The ultimate speed limit in electronic circuitry is set by the motion of the electrons themselves. Schultze et al. applied attosecond spectroscopy to glimpse this motion in a sample of silicon, the semiconducting building block of modern integrated circuits (see the Perspective by Spielmann). The technique distinguished the electron dynamics\textemdash which proceed faster than a quadrillionth of a second after laser excitation\textemdash from the comparatively slower lattice motion of the silicon atomic nuclei.

Combined with a perturbation theory for two nearly degenerate states, the formalism provides a convenient method for determining resonance transition probabilities including frequency shifts and multiple quantum transitions.

Our goal was to provide recipes and insights for modelling the harmonic response in various regimes, from the single active electron regime typical for noble gas atoms to the laser-driven attosecond hole dynamics in polyatomics. We have tried to pay particular attention to both simple recipes and their limitations, including the connection of real-valued classical and complex-valued quantum times and velocities. In addition to physical pictures, general approaches and their practical realizations, we have also tried to discuss some of the sticky technical issues, such as the possibility to factorize high harmonic response into the three steps of ionization, propagation and recombination and practical ways to treat strong field ionization, search for the saddle points of multi-dimensional integrals, deal with poles arising in the quantum-mechanical integrands, remove divergences appearing in approximate saddle point expressions, etc.},

We apply this finding to the time-domain observation of Rabi cycling between doubly excited atomic states in the few-femtosecond regime. This allows us to pinpoint the breakdown of few-level quantum dynamics at the critical laser intensity near 2 TW/cm2 in doubly excited helium. The present approach unlocks single-shot real-time-resolved signal reconstruction across timescales down to attoseconds for nonequilibrium states of matter. In contrast to conventional pump-probe schemes, there is no need for scanning time delays in order to access real-time information. The potential future applications of this technique range from testing fundamental quantum dynamics in strong fields to measuring and controlling ultrafast chemical and biological reaction processes when applied to traditional transient-absorption spectroscopy.},

In this investigation, photoemission spectroscopy, in conjunction with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses, is used to investigate the electronic structure and ultrafast charge carrier dynamics at a Si(100) surface decorated with Zn clusters. Static photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the changes in the electronic structure as the dimensionality of the Zn is increased from small clusters composed of a very few atoms to metallic Zn particles. Furthermore, femtosecond optical-pump XUV-probe photoemission spectroscopy is employed to induce a charge transfer from the p-Si(100) substrate to the Zn clusters and to measure in real time the charge trapping at the Zn cluster as well as the subsequent charge relaxation. The ultrafast charge carrier dynamics are also investigated for small clusters and metallic Zn particles. Significant transient charging of the Zn clusters after excitation of the Si(100) substrate by 800 nm light is observed for Zn coverages greater than 0.12 ML Zn, which coincides with the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between the Zn particle and the p-Si(100) substrate. The transient signals show that the charge trapping time at the Zn cluster varies with the cluster size, which is rationalized based on the electronic structure of the cluster as well as the band energy alignment at the Zn cluster\textendash Si(100) junction.},

Fano resonance is also observed in metamaterials and plasmonic nanostructures and could be explained by the coupling of two classical Lorentz oscillators. A unambiguous connection between Fano resonance and Lorentz resonance plays a vital role in the design and optimization of metamaterials and plasmonic materials for both mechanism understanding and applications. In this paper, a numerical method is employed to schematically investigate the parameters connection between Fano and Lorentz resonance. Both Fano resonant frequency and line-width are parabolic dependent with the coupling coefficient of the Lorentz oscillators. A distinct transition effect can be observed in the Fano parameters when the eigen-frequencies of Lorentz oscillators are tuned. Our results suggest that the controlling of Fano resonance can be done by designing of Lorentz resonance in metamaterials and plasmonic materials artificially, which sustains mimicking the quantum effect by classic systems.},

The broad bandwidth of the attosecond pulse and high energy resolution of the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer allow the simultaneous observation of time-dependent dynamics for many individual vibrational levels in each electronic state. Quantum beating with periods from 1.3 to 12 fs and transient line shape changes are observed among vibrational levels of a progression of electronically autoionizing Rydberg states leading to the excited A 2{$\Pi$}u N2+ ion core. Vibrational levels in the valence b 1{$\Pi$}u state exhibit 50 fs oscillation periods, revealing superpositions between individual vibrational levels within this state. Comparisons are made to previous studies of electronic wavepackets in atoms that highlight similarities to atomic behavior yet illustrate unique contributions of the diatomic molecular structure to the wavepacket, including the influence of different electronic potentials and vibrational-level-specific electronic dynamics.},

  abstract = {Attosecond transient absorption is one of the promising new techniques being developed to exploit the availability of sub-femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses to study the dynamics of the electron on its natural time scale. The temporal resolution in a transient absorption setup comes from the control of the relative delay and coherence between pump and probe pulses, while the spectral resolution comes from the characteristic width of the features that are being probed. In this review we focus on transient absorption scenarios where an attosecond pulse of XUV radiation creates a broadband excitation that is subsequently probed by a few cycle infrared (IR) laser. Because the attosecond XUV pulses are locked to the IR field cycle, the exchange of energy in the laser\textendash matter interaction can be studied with unprecedented precision. We focus on the transient absorption by helium atoms of XUV radiation around the first ionization threshold, where we can simultaneoulsy solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the single atom response and the Maxwell wave equation for the collective response of the nonlinear medium. We use a time-domain method that allows us to treat on an equal footing all the different linear and nonlinear processes by which the medium can exchange energy with the fields. We present several simple models, based on a few-level system interacting with a strong IR field, to explain many of the novel features found in attosecond transient absorption spectrograms. These include the presence of light-induced states, which demonstrate the ability to probe the dressed states of the atom. We also present a time-domain interpretation of the resonant pulse propagation features that appear in absorption spectra in dense, macroscopic media. We close by reviewing several recent experimental results that can be explained in terms of the models we discuss. Our aim is to present a road map for understanding future attosecond transient absorption experiments in more complex systems.},

  abstract = {Based on a multilevel model considering enough bound electronic states of atoms, we theoretically study the role of the transition dipole phase (TDP) in the attosecond transient absorption (ATA) spectrum of helium in intense laser fields. By solving the stationary Schr\"odinger equation with B-spline basis sets, we first calculate the transition dipole moments with well-defined phases between the bound states. Using the modified multilevel model, we reveal that the TDP plays an important role in determining the spectral structures if two or more paths populate the excited states from the ground state. Our multilevel model with the accurate TDP is convenient to address the origin of atomic ATA spectral structures by freely removing or adding specific electronic states and has been justified by comparing with the ATA spectra via directly solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Hopefully, further incorporating macroscopic propagation into the model will provide indepth physical insights into experimental ATA spectra.},

  abstract = {Understanding excited carrier dynamics in semiconductors is crucial for the development of photovoltaics and efficient photonic devices. However, overlapping spectral features in optical pump-probe spectroscopy often render assignments of separate electron and hole carrier dynamics ambiguous. Here, ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in germanium nanocrystalline thin films are directly and simultaneously observed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet at the germanium M4,5 edge. We decompose the spectra into contributions of electronic state blocking and photo-induced band shifts at a carrier density of 8 \texttimes{} 1020 cm-3. Separate electron and hole relaxation times are observed as a function of hot carrier energies. A first-order electron and hole decay of {$\sim$}1 ps suggests a Shockley\textendash Read\textendash Hall recombination mechanism. The simultaneous observation of electrons and holes with extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy paves the way for investigating few- to sub-femtosecond dynamics of both holes and electrons in complex semiconductor materials and across junctions.},

  abstract = {Semiconductor alloys containing silicon and germanium are of growing importance for compact and highly efficient photonic devices due to their favorable properties for direct integration into silicon platforms and wide tunability of optical parameters. Here, we report the simultaneous direct and energy-resolved probing of ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in a silicon-germanium alloy with the stoichiometry Si0.25Ge0.75 by extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy. Probing the photoinduced dynamics of charge carriers at the germanium M4,5-edge ({$\sim$}30\,eV) allows the germanium atoms to be used as reporter atoms for carrier dynamics in the alloy. The photoexcitation of electrons across the direct and indirect band gap into conduction band (CB) valleys and their subsequent hot carrier relaxation are observed and compared to pure germanium, where the Ge direct ({$\Delta$}Egap,Ge,direct=0.8\,eV) and Si0.25Ge0.75 indirect gaps ({$\Delta$}Egap,Si0.25Ge0.75,indirect=0.95\,eV) are comparable in energy. In the alloy, comparable carrier lifetimes are observed for the X, L, and {$\Gamma$} valleys in the conduction band. A midgap feature associated with electrons accumulating in trap states near the CB edge following intraband thermalization is observed in the Si0.25Ge0.75 alloy. The successful implementation of the reporter atom concept for capturing the dynamics of the electronic bands by site-specific probing in solids opens a route to study carrier dynamics in more complex materials with femtosecond and sub-femtosecond temporal resolution.},
