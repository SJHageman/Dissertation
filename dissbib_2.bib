  abstract = {The autocorrelation trace of an attosecond pulse train (APT) directly revealed the pulse envelope in our recent experiment on measuring the twophoton Coulomb explosion of a nitrogen molecule as a correlation signal. Although the spatial overlap of the two replicas of the APT in the correlation measurement was only achieved near the focal region owing to the spatial split of the measured APT field, which is a situation quite different from that of the correlation measurement using a Michelson interferometer, the interference fringes clearly appeared on the correlation envelope and proved the odd symmetry of the electric field to the time translation with a halfperiod of the driving laser field. In this paper, we show a simple and practical analysis for the propagation and the nonlinear interaction of an APT to simulate the experimental result of the interferometric autocorrelation of the spatially split APT. The spatial convolution of the focused electric field is essential for obtaining the fringes. We also discuss how the autocorrelation should be described in the context of the second-order perturbation theory within a dipole approximation.},

Our goal was to provide recipes and insights for modelling the harmonic response in various regimes, from the single active electron regime typical for noble gas atoms to the laser-driven attosecond hole dynamics in polyatomics. We have tried to pay particular attention to both simple recipes and their limitations, including the connection of real-valued classical and complex-valued quantum times and velocities. In addition to physical pictures, general approaches and their practical realizations, we have also tried to discuss some of the sticky technical issues, such as the possibility to factorize high harmonic response into the three steps of ionization, propagation and recombination and practical ways to treat strong field ionization, search for the saddle points of multi-dimensional integrals, deal with poles arising in the quantum-mechanical integrands, remove divergences appearing in approximate saddle point expressions, etc.},

  abstract = {High harmonic generation (HHG) of an intense laser pulse is a highly nonlinear optical phenomenon that provides the only proven source of tabletop attosecond pulses, and it is the key technology in attosecond science. Recent developments in high-intensity infrared lasers have extended HHG beyond its traditional domain of the XUV spectral range (10\textendash{}150\,eV) into the soft X-ray regime (150\,eV to 3\,keV), allowing the compactness, stability and sub-femtosecond duration of HHG to be combined with the atomic site specificity and electronic/structural sensitivity of X-ray spectroscopy. HHG in the soft X-ray spectral region has significant differences from HHG in the XUV, which necessitate new approaches to generating and characterizing attosecond pulses. Here, we examine the challenges and opportunities of soft X-ray HHG, and we use simulations to examine the optimal generating conditions for the development of high-flux, attosecond-duration pulses in the soft X-ray spectral range.This article is part of the theme issue `Measurement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics with X-rays'.},

  abstract = {Over more than a century, X-rays have transformed our understanding of the fundamental structure of matter and have been an indispensable tool for chemistry, physics, biology, materials science and related fields. Recent advances in ultrafast X-ray sources operating in the femtosecond to attosecond regimes have opened an important new frontier in X-ray science. These advances now enable: (i) sensitive probing of structural dynamics in matter on the fundamental timescales of atomic motion, (ii) element-specific probing of electronic structure and charge dynamics on fundamental timescales of electronic motion, and (iii) powerful new approaches for unravelling the coupling between electronic and atomic structural dynamics that underpin the properties and function of matter. Most notable is the recent realization of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) with numerous new XFEL facilities in operation or under development worldwide. Advances in XFELs are complemented by advances in synchrotron-based and table-top laser-plasma X-ray sources now operating in the femtosecond regime, and laser-based high-order harmonic XUV sources operating in the attosecond regime.This article is part of the theme issue `Measurement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics with X-rays'.},

By comparison to hematite ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3), an oxide analogue, the role of ligand composition and metal center density in small polaron formation time is discussed.

  volume = {97},
  abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient reflectivity around the germanium M4,5 edge (3d core-level to valence transition) at 30 eV is advanced to obtain the transient dielectric function of crystalline germanium [100] on femtosecond to picosecond time scales following photoexcitation by broadband visible-to-infrared (VIS/NIR) pulses. By fitting the transient dielectric function, carrier-phonon induced relaxations are extracted for the excited carrier distribution. The measurements reveal a hot electron relaxation rate of 3.2{$\pm$}0.2ps attributed to the X-L intervalley scattering and a hot hole relaxation rate of 600{$\pm$}300fs ascribed to intravalley scattering within the heavy hole (HH) band, both in good agreement with previous work. An overall energy shift of the XUV dielectric function is assigned to a thermally induced band gap shrinkage by formation of acoustic phonons, which is observed to be on a timescale of 4\textendash{}5 ps, in agreement with previously measured optical phonon lifetimes. The results reveal that the transient reflectivity signal at an angle of 66{$\circ$} with respect to the surface normal is dominated by changes to the real part of the dielectric function, due to the near critical angle of incidence of the experiment (66{$\circ$}\textendash{}70{$\circ$}) for the range of XUV energies used. This work provides a methodology for interpreting XUV transient reflectivity near core-level transitions, and it demonstrates the power of the XUV spectral region for measuring ultrafast excitation dynamics in solids.},

Here, we report the simultaneous direct and energy-resolved probing of ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in a silicon-germanium alloy with the stoichiometry Si0.25Ge0.75 by extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy. Probing the photoinduced dynamics of charge carriers at the germanium M4,5-edge ({$\sim$}30\,eV) allows the germanium atoms to be used as reporter atoms for carrier dynamics in the alloy. The photoexcitation of electrons across the direct and indirect band gap into conduction band (CB) valleys and their subsequent hot carrier relaxation are observed and compared to pure germanium, where the Ge direct ({$\Delta$}Egap,Ge,direct=0.8\,eV) and Si0.25Ge0.75 indirect gaps ({$\Delta$}Egap,Si0.25Ge0.75,indirect=0.95\,eV) are comparable in energy. In the alloy, comparable carrier lifetimes are observed for the X, L, and {$\Gamma$} valleys in the conduction band. A midgap feature associated with electrons accumulating in trap states near the CB edge following intraband thermalization is observed in the Si0.25Ge0.75 alloy. The successful implementation of the reporter atom concept for capturing the dynamics of the electronic bands by site-specific probing in solids opens a route to study carrier dynamics in more complex materials with femtosecond and sub-femtosecond temporal resolution.},

  abstract = {Small polaron formation is known to limit ground-state mobilities in metal oxide photocatalysts. However, the role of small polaron formation in the photoexcited state and how this affects the photoconversion efficiency has yet to be determined. Here, transient femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet measurements suggest that small polaron localization is responsible for the ultrafast trapping of photoexcited carriers in haematite ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3). Small polaron formation is evidenced by a sub-100 fs splitting of the Fe 3p core orbitals in the Fe M2,3 edge. The small polaron formation kinetics reproduces the triple-exponential relaxation frequently attributed to trap states. However, the measured spectral signature resembles only the spectral predictions of a small polaron and not the pre-edge features expected for mid-gap trap states. The small polaron formation probability, hopping radius and lifetime varies with excitation wavelength, decreasing with increasing energy in the t2g conduction band. The excitation-wavelength-dependent localization of carriers by small polaron formation is potentially a limiting factor in haematite's photoconversion efficiency.},

  abstract = {X-ray vision catches Woodward-Hoffmann
The celebrated Woodward-Hoffmann (W-H) rules rationalize a variety of rapid bond rearrangements in organic molecules. The key insight involved symmetry conservation in the electronic journey from reactant to product. Attar et al. now report femtosecond x-ray absorption spectra and accompanying simulation studies that track shifts in carbon electronic states during one such reaction: the photochemical ring opening of cyclohexadiene to hexatriene (see the Perspective by Sension). The smooth evolution that occurs in the vicinity of the pericyclic minimum provides direct affirmation of the W-H framework. Moreover, the use of a convenient tabletop apparatus bodes well for future x-ray studies of ultrafast electronic dynamics.
Science, this issue p. 54; see also p. 31
The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (\textasciitilde{}284 electron volts) on a tabletop apparatus to directly reveal the valence electronic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital energy levels. We show that this transient valence electronic structure arises within 60 {$\pm$} 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 {$\pm$} 60 fs.
X-rays reveal the rapidly evolving electronic structure of carbons rearranging from cyclohexadiene to acyclic hexatriene.

With low strong field pump intensities ({$\approx$}2 \texttimes{} 1013 W cm\textendash{}2), only ferrocenium cations are produced, and their iron 3p absorption spectrum is reported. It very closely resembles the 3p spectrum of atomic Fe+ ions but is red-shifted by 0.8 eV.

Ionization with more intense strong field pump pulses ({$\geq$}6 \texttimes{} 1013 W cm\textendash{}2) leads predominantly to the prompt production of ferrocenium ions that dissociate to give the spectral signature of bare Fe+ ions within 240 {$\pm$} 80 fs. Within the temporal resolution of the experiment ({$\approx$}40 fs), no spectral intermediates are observed, suggesting that the dissociation process occurs directly from the excited ferrocenium ion and that the bonds between the iron center and both cyclopentadienyl rings are broken almost simultaneously in an asynchronous concerted decay process. No evidence of slower dissociation channels is observed at a pump\textendash{}probe delay of 250 ps, suggesting that all energy is very rapidly routed into dissociative states.},

  abstract = {Strong-field ionization (SFI) is a key process for accessing real-time quantum dynamics of electrons on the attosecond timescale. The theoretical foundation of SFI was pioneered in the 1960s, and later refined by various analytical models. While asymptotic ionization rates predicted by these models have been tested to be in reasonable agreement for a wide range of laser parameters, predictions for SFI on the sub-laser-cycle timescale are either beyond the scope of the models or show strong qualitative deviations from full quantum-mechanical simulations. Here, using the unprecedented state specificity of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we follow the real-time SFI process of the two valence spin\textendash{}orbit states of xenon. The results reveal that the irreversible tunnelling contribution is accompanied by a reversible electronic population that exhibits an observable spin\textendash{}orbit-dependent phase delay. A detailed theoretical analysis attributes this observation to transient ground-state polarization, an unexpected facet of SFI that cannot be captured by existing analytical models that focus exclusively on the production of asymptotic electron/ion yields.},

The major elimination products are bromine atoms in charge states of 0, +1, and +2. The charge state distribution is strongly dependent on the incident NIR intensity. While the yield of neutral fragments is essentially constant for all measurements, charged fragment yields grow rapidly with increasing NIR intensities with the most pronounced effect observed for Br++. However, the appearance times of all bromine fragments are independent of the incident field strength; these are found to be 320 fs, 70 fs, and 30 fs for Br\textperiodcentered, Br+, and Br++, respectively. Transient molecular ion features assigned to DBE+ and DBE++ are observed, with dynamics linked to the production of Br+ products. Neutral Br\textperiodcentered{} atoms are produced on a timescale consistent with dissociation of DBE+ ions on a shallow potential energy surface. The appearance of Br+ ions by dissociative ionization is also seen, as evidenced by the simultaneous decay of a DBE+ ionic species. Dicationic Br++ products emerge within the instrument response time, presumably from Coulomb explosion of triply charged DBE.},

Extensions of these experiments to other semiconductors, such as germanium, and other transition metal oxides, such as vanadium dioxide, are discussed.

A synchronized few-cycle near infrared (NIR) pulse modifies the oscillating dipoles of argon impulsively, leading to alterations in the VUV absorption spectra. As the NIR pulse is delayed with respect to the VUV pulse, multiple features in the absorption profile emerge simultaneously including line broadening, sideband structure, sub-cycle fast modulations, and 5\textendash{}10 fs slow modulations. These features indicate the coexistence of two general processes of the light\textendash{}matter interaction: the energy shift of individual atomic levels and coherent population transfer between atomic eigenstates, revealing coherent superpositions.

  abstract = {Attosecond transient absorption spectra near the energies of autoionizing states are analyzed in terms of the photon coupling mechanisms to other states. In a recent experiment, the autoionization lifetimes of highly excited states of xenon were determined and compared to a simple expression based on a model of how quantum coherence determines the decay of a metastable state in the transient absorption spectrum. Here it is shown that this procedure for extracting lifetimes is more general and can be used in cases involving either resonant or nonresonant coupling of the attosecond-probed autoionizing state to either continua or discrete states by a time-delayed near infrared (NIR) pulse. The fits of theoretically simulated absorption signals for the 6p resonance in xenon (lifetime = 21.1 fs) to this expression yield the correct decay constant for all the coupling mechanisms considered, properly recovering the time signature of twice the autoionization lifetime due to the coherent nature of the transient absorption experiment. To distinguish between these two coupling cases, the characteristic dependencies of the transient absorption signals on both the photon energy and time delay are investigated. Additional oscillations versus delay-time in the measured spectrum are shown and quantum beat analysis is used to pinpoint the major photon-coupling mechanism induced by the NIR pulse in the current xenon experiment: the NIR pulse resonantly couples the attosecond-probed state, 6p, to an intermediate 8s (at 22.563 eV), and this 8s state is also coupled to a neighboring state (at 20.808 eV).},

Novel transient absorption experiments in gases using isolated attosecond pulses are performed in two regimes, one in which the attosecond pulse is overlapped in time with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse and one in which the NIR pulse follows the attosecond pulse. In the latter regime, the attosecond pulse first interacts with a sample, then the observed absorption features are modified by a NIR pulse, which interacts with the sample well after the attosecond pulse has passed. In these experiments, which seem counterintuitive when compared to conventional transient absorption spectroscopy, the weak attosecond pulse induces a polarization of the medium, which is then perturbed by the time-delayed NIR pulse. Recent measurements demonstrate the rich variety of information that can be extracted in this regime.},

Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy is used to resolve this process in silicon in real time. Electrons injected into the conduction band by few-cycle laser pulses alter the silicon XUV absorption spectrum in sharp steps synchronized with the laser electric field oscillations. The observed \textasciitilde{}450-attosecond step rise time provides an upper limit for the carrier-induced band-gap reduction and the electron-electron scattering time in the conduction band. This electronic response is separated from the subsequent band-gap modifications due to lattice motion, which occurs on a time scale of 60 {$\pm$} 10 femtoseconds, characteristic of the fastest optical phonon. Quantum dynamical simulations interpret the carrier injection step as light-field\textendash{}induced electron tunneling.
Watching electrons dart through silicon
The ultimate speed limit in electronic circuitry is set by the motion of the electrons themselves. Schultze et al. applied attosecond spectroscopy to glimpse this motion in a sample of silicon, the semiconducting building block of modern integrated circuits (see the Perspective by Spielmann). The technique distinguished the electron dynamics\textemdash{}which proceed faster than a quadrillionth of a second after laser excitation\textemdash{}from the comparatively slower lattice motion of the silicon atomic nuclei.

In this investigation, photoemission spectroscopy, in conjunction with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses, is used to investigate the electronic structure and ultrafast charge carrier dynamics at a Si(100) surface decorated with Zn clusters. Static photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the changes in the electronic structure as the dimensionality of the Zn is increased from small clusters composed of a very few atoms to metallic Zn particles. Furthermore, femtosecond optical-pump XUV-probe photoemission spectroscopy is employed to induce a charge transfer from the p-Si(100) substrate to the Zn clusters and to measure in real time the charge trapping at the Zn cluster as well as the subsequent charge relaxation. The ultrafast charge carrier dynamics are also investigated for small clusters and metallic Zn particles. Significant transient charging of the Zn clusters after excitation of the Si(100) substrate by 800 nm light is observed for Zn coverages greater than 0.12 ML Zn, which coincides with the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between the Zn particle and the p-Si(100) substrate. The transient signals show that the charge trapping time at the Zn cluster varies with the cluster size, which is rationalized based on the electronic structure of the cluster as well as the band energy alignment at the Zn cluster\textendash{}Si(100) junction.},

  copyright = {info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess},
  abstract = {Within this work, electron dynamics in atoms are experimentally and numerically investigated on their natural attosecond time scales. To access these dynamics, ultrashort and moderately-intense few-cycle laser pulses are superposed with attosecond pulsed radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral region. Both these sources are combined in a new experimental vacuum setup which was designed and built up from scratch, also in order to generate the attosecond pulses. Novel experimental schemes are developed which involve the temporal and spectral interferometric utilization of both ultrashort light sources and include the multidimensional spectroscopy employing different dynamical parameters. These are the intensity and the carrier-envelope phase of the laser pulses, as well as their temporal delay with respect to the attosecond pulses. Scientifically, the observation and control of the quantum-motion of bound electrons, as well as the laser-driven quasi-classical motion of free electrons was a key goal of this work. In particular, a bound two-electron wave packet in helium on attosecond time scales was experimentally observed for the first time. This was realized by combining unprecedented high temporal and spectral resolution. In addition, a new coupling mechanism of several doubly-excited states to an effective single-electron continuum is identified and analyzed. Both these two-electron states as well as single-electron states are interferometrically investigated with access to the phase of their quantum-mechanical wave function. This allows the observation and control of the quantum dynamics of two correlated electrons in atoms on the attosecond time scale which was demonstrated within the scope of this work.},

At the same time, as the harmonic orders increase, the extreme points on the curve of coherence degree vs. carrier-envelope phase shift toward the direction of carrier-envelope phase increasing. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the ionization induced frequency chirp plays an important role in the Carrier-Envelope Phase Effects on the Spatial Coherence.

  abstract = {Attosecond transient absorption is one of the promising new techniques being developed to exploit the availability of sub-femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses to study the dynamics of the electron on its natural time scale. The temporal resolution in a transient absorption setup comes from the control of the relative delay and coherence between pump and probe pulses, while the spectral resolution comes from the characteristic width of the features that are being probed. In this review we focus on transient absorption scenarios where an attosecond pulse of XUV radiation creates a broadband excitation that is subsequently probed by a few cycle infrared (IR) laser. Because the attosecond XUV pulses are locked to the IR field cycle, the exchange of energy in the laser\textendash{}matter interaction can be studied with unprecedented precision. We focus on the transient absorption by helium atoms of XUV radiation around the first ionization threshold, where we can simultaneoulsy solve the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the single atom response and the Maxwell wave equation for the collective response of the nonlinear medium. We use a time-domain method that allows us to treat on an equal footing all the different linear and nonlinear processes by which the medium can exchange energy with the fields. We present several simple models, based on a few-level system interacting with a strong IR field, to explain many of the novel features found in attosecond transient absorption spectrograms. These include the presence of light-induced states, which demonstrate the ability to probe the dressed states of the atom. We also present a time-domain interpretation of the resonant pulse propagation features that appear in absorption spectra in dense, macroscopic media. We close by reviewing several recent experimental results that can be explained in terms of the models we discuss. Our aim is to present a road map for understanding future attosecond transient absorption experiments in more complex systems.},

It is shown using a time-independent resonant scattering approach that the Fano parametrization may be applied to overlapping resonances. For the Dubau-Seaton profile an exact expression of the closed-channel phase shift is obtained. We find that regarding the window character of the Ar 3s series the Fano parameters calculated using the multichannel multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method are in good agreement with those derived from fitting a convoluted Fano function to the measured n=4 autoionizing resonance. The Fano parameters are also derived from perfect fits to the 5{$\leq$}n{$\leq$}8 resonances which tests the validity of this parametrization to overlapping members of an inner-valence electron resonance series. In contrast, a parametrization of the entire series based upon the Dubau-Seaton formula did not result in a good fit without modifications. Using the same value of the shape parameter we find, however, that the n=4 resonance can be accurately represented by both the Fano and Dubau-Seaton profiles.},

With the available fittings of the photoabsorption cross sections and with a new compilation of such data for the region 30\textendash{}300 eV, continuous sets of the photoabsorption cross sections from 30 to 10 000 eV have been determined for 94 elements. With these, for the region 100\textendash{}2000 eV, atomic scattering factors which are independent of scattering angle and which include the relatively strong anomalous dispersion structures have been obtained. Methods are reviewed and currently important examples of the application of atomic scattering factors to the detailed characterization of selected x-ray mirror monochromators and of Bragg multilayer and crystal analyzers for low-energy x-ray analysis are presented.},

The interferometer is based on the Fresnel bimirror setup. It works near the zero path difference and requires only little spatial coherence. Plane mirrors at grazing incidence are the only optical elements. Interference fringes have been recorded at 4.8 nm, near the K edge of carbon. An index value could be obtained by measuring the fringe pattern shift between two such records, one without and one with a sample in one optical path. An estimation of the noise-limited accuracy in such an index determination shows that a few parts in 10-6 can be anticipated.},

  abstract = {We review dispersion relations, which relate the real part of the optical susceptibility (refraction) to the imaginary part (absorption). We derive and discuss these relations as applied to nonlinear optical systems. It is shown that in the nonlinear case, for self-action effects the correct form for such dispersion relations is nondegenerate, i.e. it is necessary to use multiple frequency arguments. Nonlinear dispersion relations have been shown to be very useful as they usually only require integration over a limited frequency range (corresponding to frequencies at which the absorption changes), unlike the conventional linear Kramers-Kr{\"o}nig relation which requires integration over all absorbing frequencies. Furthermore, calculation of refractive index changes using dispersion relations is easier than a direct calculation of the susceptibility, as transition rates (which give absorption coefficients) are, in general, far easier to calculate than the expectation value of the optical polarization. Both resonant (generation of some excitation that is long lived compared with an optical period) and nonresonant `instantaneous' optical nonlinearities are discussed, and it is shown that the nonlinear dispersion relation has a common form and can be understood in terms of the linear Kramers-Kr{\"o}nig relation applied to a new system consisting of the material plus some `perturbation'. We present several examples of the form of this external perturbation, which can be viewed as the pump in a pump-probe experiment. We discuss the two-level saturated atom model and bandfilling in semiconductors among others for the resonant case. For the nonresonant case some recent work is included where the electronic nonlinear refractive coefficient,n2, is determined from the nonlinear absorption processes of two-photon absorption, Raman transitions and the a.c. Stark effect. We also review how the dispersion relations can be extended to give alternative forms for frequency summation which, for example, allows the real and imaginary parts of{$\chi$}(2) to be related.},

The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

We offer a completely different approach: in situ measurement. That is, we integrate attosecond-pulse production and measurement in a manner that can be applied to many high-order nonlinear interactions. To demonstrate this approach, we combine a low-intensity ({$<$}10-3) second-harmonic beam with the fundamental beam, to gently perturb the production process without significantly modifying it. The attosecond-pulse duration is read from the modulation of the even-harmonic signal as a function of the two-field delay. Increasing the second-harmonic intensity slightly ({$<$}10-2), we extend measurement to control. We demonstrate control by manipulating the high-harmonic spectrum with high efficiency.},

Transient extreme ultraviolet reflection-absorption (XUV-RA) spectroscopy is able to follow surface electron dynamics due to its element, oxidation-state, and surface specificity, as well as the ultrafast time-resolution which can be achieved with XUV pulses produced by high harmonic generation. Here, we use ultrafast XUV-RA spectroscopy to show that charge localization and small polaron formation in Fe2O3 occur within {$\sim$}660 fs. The photoexcitation of hematite at 400 nm initially leads to an electronically-delocalized ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) state, which subsequently evolves into a surface localized LMCT state. Comparison of the charge carrier dynamics for single and polycrystalline samples shows that the observed dynamics are negligibly influenced by grain boundaries and surface defects. Rather, correlation between experimental results and spectral simulations reveals that the lattice expansion during small polaron formation occurs on the identical time scale as surface trapping and represents the probable driving force for sub-ps electron localization to the hematite surface.},

This allows us to pinpoint the breakdown of few-level quantum dynamics at the critical laser intensity near 2 TW/cm2 in doubly excited helium. The present approach unlocks single-shot real-time-resolved signal reconstruction across timescales down to attoseconds for nonequilibrium states of matter. In contrast to conventional pump-probe schemes, there is no need for scanning time delays in order to access real-time information.

Numerical results are interpreted in terms of an analytical model based on interaction operators, which quantify the transformation undergone by the system under the action of an intense pulse. The oscillating features of the resulting transient-absorption spectra, due to the coupling of several excited states, are thus interpreted in terms of the atomic population and phase changes imposed by the pump and probe pulses. Strong-field-induced phases and their influence on the resulting transient-absorption spectra are thereby investigated for different values of pump and probe intensities and frequencies, focusing on the atomic properties which are encoded in the absorption line shapes for positive and negative time delays.},

  abstract = {Watching as helium goes topsy-turvy
Theorists have long pondered the underpinnings of the Fano resonance, a spectral feature that resembles adjacent rightside-up and upside-down peaks. An especially well-studied instance of this feature appears in the electronic spectrum of helium as a transient state undergoes delayed ionization. Two studies have now traced the dynamics of this state in real time. Gruson et al. used photoelectron spectroscopy to extract the amplitude and phase of the electron wave packet after inducing its interference with reference wave packets tuned into resonance at variable delays. Kaldun et al. used extreme ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy to probe the transient state while variably forcing ionization with a strong near-infrared field.
Science, this issue pp. 734 and 738
Although the time-dependent buildup of asymmetric Fano line shapes in absorption spectra has been of great theoretical interest in the past decade, experimental verification of the predictions has been elusive. Here, we report the experimental observation of the emergence of a Fano resonance in the prototype system of helium by interrupting the autoionization process of a correlated two-electron excited state with a strong laser field. The tunable temporal gate between excitation and termination of the resonance allows us to follow the formation of a Fano line shape in time. The agreement with ab initio calculations validates our experimental time-gating technique for addressing an even broader range of topics, such as the emergence of electron correlation, the onset of electron-internuclear coupling, and quasi-particle formation.

  abstract = {We investigate the evolution of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral line shapes in an optically thick helium gas under near-infrared (IR) perturbation. In our experimental and theoretical work, we systematically vary the IR intensity, time-delay, gas density, and IR polarization parameters to study line-shape modifications induced by collective interactions in a regime beyond the single-atom response of a thin, dilute gas. In both experiment and theory, we find that specific features in the frequency-domain absorption profile, and their evolution with propagation distance, can be attributed to the interplay between resonant attosecond pulse propagation and IR-induced phase shifts. Our calculations show that this interplay also manifests itself in the time domain, with the IR pulse influencing the reshaping of the XUV pulse propagating in the resonant medium.},

  volume = {115},
  abstract = {The evolution of a V-type three-level system is studied, whose two resonances are coherently excited and coupled by two ultrashort laser pump and probe pulses, separated by a varying time delay. We relate the quantum dynamics of the excited multilevel system to the absorption spectrum of the transmitted probe pulse. In particular, by analyzing the quantum evolution of the system, we interpret how atomic phases are differently encoded in the time-delay-dependent spectral absorption profiles when the pump pulse either precedes or follows the probe pulse. This scheme is experimentally applied to atomic Rb, whose fine-structure-split 5s 2S1/2\textrightarrow{}5p 2P1/2 and 5s 2S1/2\textrightarrow{}5p 2P3/2 transitions are driven by the combined action of a pump pulse of variable intensity and a delayed probe pulse. The provided understanding of the relationship between quantum phases and absorption spectra represents an important step towards full time-dependent phase reconstruction (quantum holography) of bound-state wave packets in strong-field light-matter interactions with atoms, molecules, and solids.},
