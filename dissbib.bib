Although the spatial overlap of the two replicas of the APT in the correlation measurement was only achieved near the focal region owing to the spatial split of the measured APT ﬁeld, which is a situation quite different from that of the correlation measurement using a Michelson interferometer, the interference fringes clearly appeared on the correlation envelope and proved the odd symmetry of the electric ﬁeld to the time translation with a halfperiod of the driving laser ﬁeld. In this paper, we show a simple and practical analysis for the propagation and the nonlinear interaction of an APT to simulate the experimental result of the interferometric autocorrelation of the spatially split APT. The spatial convolution of the focused electric ﬁeld is essential for obtaining the fringes. We also discuss how the autocorrelation should be described in the context of the second-order perturbation theory within a dipole approximation.},

Recently, several experiments have been performed exploiting non-collinear geometry, such as HHG in a grating of excited molecules created by crossing beams. In such studies, harmonics were observed at propagation directions different from those of the driving pulses; moreover the scattered harmonics were angularly dispersed.},

	abstract = {From the famous classical "simple man" model to the recent multichannel model for polyatomic molecules, this tutorial will guide you through the several landmarks in our understanding of high harmonic generation and high harmonic spectroscopy. Our goal was to provide recipes and insights for modelling the harmonic response in various regimes, from the single active electron regime typical for noble gas atoms to the laser-driven attosecond hole dynamics in polyatomics. We have tried to pay particular attention to both simple recipes and their limitations, including the connection of real-valued classical and complex-valued quantum times and velocities. In addition to physical pictures, general approaches and their practical realizations, we have also tried to discuss some of the sticky technical issues, such as the possibility to factorize high harmonic response into the three steps of ionization, propagation and recombination and practical ways to treat strong field ionization, search for the saddle points of multi-dimensional integrals, deal with poles arising in the quantum-mechanical integrands, remove divergences appearing in approximate saddle point expressions, etc.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a Fourier transform spectrometer in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectrum using a high-harmonic source, with wavelengths as short as 32 nm. The femtosecond infrared laser source is divided into two separate foci in the same gas jet to create two synchronized XUV sources. An interferometric method to determine the relative delay between the two sources is shown to improve the accuracy of the delay time, with corrections of up to 200 asec required. By correcting the time base before the Fourier transform, the frequency resolution is improved by up to an order of magnitude.},
