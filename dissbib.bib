Although the spatial overlap of the two replicas of the APT in the correlation measurement was only achieved near the focal region owing to the spatial split of the measured APT field, which is a situation quite different from that of the correlation measurement using a Michelson interferometer, the interference fringes clearly appeared on the correlation envelope and proved the odd symmetry of the electric field to the time translation with a halfperiod of the driving laser field. In this paper, we show a simple and practical analysis for the propagation and the nonlinear interaction of an APT to simulate the experimental result of the interferometric autocorrelation of the spatially split APT. The spatial convolution of the focused electric field is essential for obtaining the fringes. We also discuss how the autocorrelation should be described in the context of the second-order perturbation theory within a dipole approximation.},

Owing to the complexity of the experimental setup for the generation and characterization of harmonics, as well as to the large computational costs of numerical modelling, HHG is generally performed and modelled in collinear geometry. Recently, several experiments have been performed exploiting non-collinear geometry, such as HHG in a grating of excited molecules created by crossing beams. In such studies, harmonics were observed at propagation directions different from those of the driving pulses; moreover the scattered harmonics were angularly dispersed.},

Our goal was to provide recipes and insights for modelling the harmonic response in various regimes, from the single active electron regime typical for noble gas atoms to the laser-driven attosecond hole dynamics in polyatomics. We have tried to pay particular attention to both simple recipes and their limitations, including the connection of real-valued classical and complex-valued quantum times and velocities. In addition to physical pictures, general approaches and their practical realizations, we have also tried to discuss some of the sticky technical issues, such as the possibility to factorize high harmonic response into the three steps of ionization, propagation and recombination and practical ways to treat strong field ionization, search for the saddle points of multi-dimensional integrals, deal with poles arising in the quantum-mechanical integrands, remove divergences appearing in approximate saddle point expressions, etc.},

Our setup is based on an optical parametric amplification system with an 800\&\#x00A0;nm pump shaped with a spiral phase plate. We confirm the anisotropic OAM transfer from the pump to the idler through stimulated difference frequency generation by measuring the diffraction patterns of a triangular aperture illuminated by the signal, pump, and idler beams. The tunability of the setup is demonstrated by performing measurements at 3.0 and 3.6\&\#x00A0;\&\#x03BC;m idler wavelengths. This result provides a robust method of controlling OAM in strong field physics and designing secondary sources carrying OAM in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range through high-order harmonics generation.},

We outline how coherent broadband X-ray radiation, emitted in high-harmonic generation, can be used to follow dynamics in increasingly complex systems. Experiments performed in both molecules and solids are discussed at length, on time scales ranging from attoseconds to picoseconds, and in perturbative or strong-field excitation regimes.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Measurement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics with X-rays’.},

Recent developments in high-intensity infrared lasers have extended HHG beyond its traditional domain of the XUV spectral range (10–150\,eV) into the soft X-ray regime (150\,eV to 3\,keV), allowing the compactness, stability and sub-femtosecond duration of HHG to be combined with the atomic site specificity and electronic/structural sensitivity of X-ray spectroscopy. HHG in the soft X-ray spectral region has significant differences from HHG in the XUV, which necessitate new approaches to generating and characterizing attosecond pulses. Here, we examine the challenges and opportunities of soft X-ray HHG, and we use simulations to examine the optimal generating conditions for the development of high-flux, attosecond-duration pulses in the soft X-ray spectral range.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Measurement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics with X-rays’.},

Recent advances in ultrafast X-ray sources operating in the femtosecond to attosecond regimes have opened an important new frontier in X-ray science. These advances now enable: (i) sensitive probing of structural dynamics in matter on the fundamental timescales of atomic motion, (ii) element-specific probing of electronic structure and charge dynamics on fundamental timescales of electronic motion, and (iii) powerful new approaches for unravelling the coupling between electronic and atomic structural dynamics that underpin the properties and function of matter. Most notable is the recent realization of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) with numerous new XFEL facilities in operation or under development worldwide. Advances in XFELs are complemented by advances in synchrotron-based and table-top laser-plasma X-ray sources now operating in the femtosecond regime, and laser-based high-order harmonic XUV sources operating in the attosecond regime.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Measurement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics with X-rays’.},

Uncertainty remains as~to what degree the core–hole created by the XUV transition modifies the measurement of photoexcited electron and hole energies. Here, the Si L2,3 edge is measured after photoexcitation of electrons to the Δ, L, and Γ valleys of Si(100). The measured changes in the XUV transition probability do not energetically agree with the increasing electron photoexcitation energy. The data~experimentally confirm that, for the Si L2,3 edge, the time-dependent electron and hole energies are partially obscured by the core–hole perturbation. A model based on many-body approximations and the Bethe–Salpeter equation is successfully used to predict the core-hole~modification~of the final transition density of states in terms of both electronic and structural dynamics. The resulting fit time constants match the excited-state electron thermalization time and the intervalley electron–phonon, intravalley electron–phonon, and phonon–phonon scattering times previously measured in silicon. The outlined approach is a more comprehensive framework for interpreting transient XUV absorption spectra in photoexcited semiconductors.},

  abstract = {Small polaron formation limits the mobility and lifetimes of photoexcited carriers in metal oxides. As the ligand field strength increases, the carrier mobility decreases, but the effect on the photoexcited small polaron formation is still unknown. Extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy is employed to measure small polaron formation rates and probabilities in goethite (α-FeOOH) crystalline nanorods at pump photon energies from 2.2 to 3.1 eV. The measured polaron formation time increases with excitation photon energy from 70 ± 10 fs at 2.2 eV to 350 ± 30 fs at 2.6 eV, whereas the polaron formation probability (85 ± 10\%) remains constant. By comparison to hematite (α-Fe2O3), an oxide analogue, the role of ligand composition and metal center density in small polaron formation time is discussed. This work suggests that incorporating small changes in ligands and crystal structure could enable the control of photoexcited small polaron formation in metal oxides.},

  abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient reflectivity around the germanium M4,5 edge (3d core-level to valence transition) at 30 eV is advanced to obtain the transient dielectric function of crystalline germanium [100] on femtosecond to picosecond time scales following photoexcitation by broadband visible-to-infrared (VIS/NIR) pulses. By fitting the transient dielectric function, carrier-phonon induced relaxations are extracted for the excited carrier distribution. The measurements reveal a hot electron relaxation rate of 3.2±0.2ps attributed to the X−L intervalley scattering and a hot hole relaxation rate of 600±300fs ascribed to intravalley scattering within the heavy hole (HH) band, both in good agreement with previous work. An overall energy shift of the XUV dielectric function is assigned to a thermally induced band gap shrinkage by formation of acoustic phonons, which is observed to be on a timescale of 4–5 ps, in agreement with previously measured optical phonon lifetimes. The results reveal that the transient reflectivity signal at an angle of 66∘ with respect to the surface normal is dominated by changes to the real part of the dielectric function, due to the near critical angle of incidence of the experiment (66∘–70∘) for the range of XUV energies used. This work provides a methodology for interpreting XUV transient reflectivity near core-level transitions, and it demonstrates the power of the XUV spectral region for measuring ultrafast excitation dynamics in solids.},

Here, we report the simultaneous direct and energy-resolved probing of ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in a silicon-germanium alloy with the stoichiometry Si0.25Ge0.75 by extreme ultraviolet transient absorption spectroscopy. Probing the photoinduced dynamics of charge carriers at the germanium M4,5-edge (∼30\,eV) allows the germanium atoms to be used as reporter atoms for carrier dynamics in the alloy. The photoexcitation of electrons across the direct and indirect band gap into conduction band (CB) valleys and their subsequent hot carrier relaxation are observed and compared to pure germanium, where the Ge direct (ΔEgap,Ge,direct=0.8\,eV) and Si0.25Ge0.75 indirect gaps (ΔEgap,Si0.25Ge0.75,indirect=0.95\,eV) are comparable in energy. In the alloy, comparable carrier lifetimes are observed for the X, L, and Γ valleys in the conduction band. A midgap feature associated with electrons accumulating in trap states near the CB edge following intraband thermalization is observed in the Si0.25Ge0.75 alloy. The successful implementation of the reporter atom concept for capturing the dynamics of the electronic bands by site-specific probing in solids opens a route to study carrier dynamics in more complex materials with femtosecond and sub-femtosecond temporal resolution.},

  abstract = {Small polaron formation is known to limit ground-state mobilities in metal oxide photocatalysts. However, the role of small polaron formation in the photoexcited state and how this affects the photoconversion efficiency has yet to be determined. Here, transient femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet measurements suggest that small polaron localization is responsible for the ultrafast trapping of photoexcited carriers in haematite (α-Fe2O3). Small polaron formation is evidenced by a sub-100 fs splitting of the Fe 3p core orbitals in the Fe M2,3 edge. The small polaron formation kinetics reproduces the triple-exponential relaxation frequently attributed to trap states. However, the measured spectral signature resembles only the spectral predictions of a small polaron and not the pre-edge features expected for mid-gap trap states. The small polaron formation probability, hopping radius and lifetime varies with excitation wavelength, decreasing with increasing energy in the t2g conduction band. The excitation-wavelength-dependent localization of carriers by small polaron formation is potentially a limiting factor in haematite’s photoconversion efficiency.},

Here, ultrafast electron and hole dynamics in germanium nanocrystalline thin films are directly and simultaneously observed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet at the germanium M4,5 edge. We decompose the spectra into contributions of electronic state blocking and photo-induced band shifts at a carrier density of 8 × 1020 cm−3. Separate electron and hole relaxation times are observed as a function of hot carrier energies. A first-order electron and hole decay of ∼1 ps suggests a Shockley–Read–Hall recombination mechanism.

  abstract = {We present attosecond transient-absorption experiments on xenon 4d−16p core-level states resonantly driven by intense (1.6×1014W/cm2) few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses. In this strongly driven regime, broad induced absorption features with half-cycle (1.3-fs) delay-dependent modulation are observed over the range of 58–65 eV, predicted as a signature of the breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation in strong-field driving of Autler-Townes splitting [A. N. Pfeiffer and S. R. Leone, Phys. Rev. A 85, 053422 (2012)]. Relevant atomic states are identified by a numerical model involving three electronic states, and the mechanism behind the broad induced absorption is discussed in the Floquet formalism. These results demonstrate that a near-infrared field well into the tunneling regime can still control the optical properties of an atomic system over a several-electron-volt spectral range and with attosecond precision.},

  abstract = {X-ray vision catches Woodward-Hoffmann
The celebrated Woodward-Hoffmann (W-H) rules rationalize a variety of rapid bond rearrangements in organic molecules. The key insight involved symmetry conservation in the electronic journey from reactant to product. Attar et al. now report femtosecond x-ray absorption spectra and accompanying simulation studies that track shifts in carbon electronic states during one such reaction: the photochemical ring opening of cyclohexadiene to hexatriene (see the Perspective by Sension). The smooth evolution that occurs in the vicinity of the pericyclic minimum provides direct affirmation of the W-H framework. Moreover, the use of a convenient tabletop apparatus bodes well for future x-ray studies of ultrafast electronic dynamics.
Science, this issue p. 54; see also p. 31
The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (\textasciitilde{}284 electron volts) on a tabletop apparatus to directly reveal the valence electronic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital energy levels. We show that this transient valence electronic structure arises within 60 ± 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 ± 60 fs.
X-rays reveal the rapidly evolving electronic structure of carbons rearranging from cyclohexadiene to acyclic hexatriene.

Employing transitions in the vicinity of the iron 3p (M2,3) edge, the dissociation is monitored from the point of view of the iron atom. With low strong field pump intensities (≈2 × 1013 W cm–2), only ferrocenium cations are produced, and their iron 3p absorption spectrum is reported. It very closely resembles the 3p spectrum of atomic Fe+ ions but is red-shifted by 0.8 eV. With the aid of time-dependent density functional theory calculations, the spectrum is assigned to a combination of doublet and quartet spin states of ferrocenium ions. Ionization with more intense strong field pump pulses (≥6 × 1013 W cm–2) leads predominantly to the prompt production of ferrocenium ions that dissociate to give the spectral signature of bare Fe+ ions within 240 ± 80 fs. Within the temporal resolution of the experiment (≈40 fs), no spectral intermediates are observed, suggesting that the dissociation process occurs directly from the excited ferrocenium ion and that the bonds between the iron center and both cyclopentadienyl rings are broken almost simultaneously in an asynchronous concerted decay process. No evidence of slower dissociation channels is observed at a pump–probe delay of 250 ps, suggesting that all energy is very rapidly routed into dissociative states.},

  abstract = {Strong-field ionization (SFI) is a key process for accessing real-time quantum dynamics of electrons on the attosecond timescale. The theoretical foundation of SFI was pioneered in the 1960s, and later refined by various analytical models. While asymptotic ionization rates predicted by these models have been tested to be in reasonable agreement for a wide range of laser parameters, predictions for SFI on the sub-laser-cycle timescale are either beyond the scope of the models or show strong qualitative deviations from full quantum-mechanical simulations. Here, using the unprecedented state specificity of attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, we follow the real-time SFI process of the two valence spin–orbit states of xenon. The results reveal that the irreversible tunnelling contribution is accompanied by a reversible electronic population that exhibits an observable spin–orbit-dependent phase delay. A detailed theoretical analysis attributes this observation to transient ground-state polarization, an unexpected facet of SFI that cannot be captured by existing analytical models that focus exclusively on the production of asymptotic electron/ion yields.},

The major elimination products are bromine atoms in charge states of 0, +1, and +2. The charge state distribution is strongly dependent on the incident NIR intensity. While the yield of neutral fragments is essentially constant for all measurements, charged fragment yields grow rapidly with increasing NIR intensities with the most pronounced effect observed for Br++. However, the appearance times of all bromine fragments are independent of the incident field strength; these are found to be 320 fs, 70 fs, and 30 fs for Br˙, Br+, and Br++, respectively. Transient molecular ion features assigned to DBE+ and DBE++ are observed, with dynamics linked to the production of Br+ products. Neutral Br˙ atoms are produced on a timescale consistent with dissociation of DBE+ ions on a shallow potential energy surface. The appearance of Br+ ions by dissociative ionization is also seen, as evidenced by the simultaneous decay of a DBE+ ionic species. Dicationic Br++ products emerge within the instrument response time, presumably from Coulomb explosion of triply charged DBE.},

Femtosecond transient absorption on iron and cobalt oxides identifies ligand-to-metal charge transfer as the main spectroscopic transition, rather than metal-to-metal charge transfer or d–d transitions, upon photoexcitation in the visible. In silicon, attosecond transient absorption reveals that electrons tunnel into the conduction band from the valence band under strong-field excitation, to energies as high as 6~eV above the conduction band minimum. Extensions of these experiments to other semiconductors, such as germanium, and other transition metal oxides, such as vanadium dioxide, are discussed. Germanium is of particular interest because it should be possible to follow both electron and hole dynamics in a single measurement using transient XUV absorption.},

The broad bandwidth of the attosecond pulse and high energy resolution of the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer allow the simultaneous observation of time-dependent dynamics for many individual vibrational levels in each electronic state. Quantum beating with periods from 1.3 to 12 fs and transient line shape changes are observed among vibrational levels of a progression of electronically autoionizing Rydberg states leading to the excited A 2Πu N2+ ion core. Vibrational levels in the valence b 1Πu state exhibit 50 fs oscillation periods, revealing superpositions between individual vibrational levels within this state.

A synchronized few-cycle near infrared (NIR) pulse modifies the oscillating dipoles of argon impulsively, leading to alterations in the VUV absorption spectra. As the NIR pulse is delayed with respect to the VUV pulse, multiple features in the absorption profile emerge simultaneously including line broadening, sideband structure, sub-cycle fast modulations, and 5–10 fs slow modulations. These features indicate the coexistence of two general processes of the light–matter interaction: the energy shift of individual atomic levels and coherent population transfer between atomic eigenstates, revealing coherent superpositions.

  abstract = {Attosecond transient absorption spectra near the energies of autoionizing states are analyzed in terms of the photon coupling mechanisms to other states. In a recent experiment, the autoionization lifetimes of highly excited states of xenon were determined and compared to a simple expression based on a model of how quantum coherence determines the decay of a metastable state in the transient absorption spectrum. Here it is shown that this procedure for extracting lifetimes is more general and can be used in cases involving either resonant or nonresonant coupling of the attosecond-probed autoionizing state to either continua or discrete states by a time-delayed near infrared (NIR) pulse. The fits of theoretically simulated absorption signals for the 6p resonance in xenon (lifetime = 21.1 fs) to this expression yield the correct decay constant for all the coupling mechanisms considered, properly recovering the time signature of twice the autoionization lifetime due to the coherent nature of the transient absorption experiment. To distinguish between these two coupling cases, the characteristic dependencies of the transient absorption signals on both the photon energy and time delay are investigated. Additional oscillations versus delay-time in the measured spectrum are shown and quantum beat analysis is used to pinpoint the major photon-coupling mechanism induced by the NIR pulse in the current xenon experiment: the NIR pulse resonantly couples the attosecond-probed state, 6p, to an intermediate 8s (at 22.563 eV), and this 8s state is also coupled to a neighboring state (at 20.808 eV).},

In the latter regime, the attosecond pulse first interacts with a sample, then the observed absorption features are modified by a NIR pulse, which interacts with the sample well after the attosecond pulse has passed. In these experiments, which seem counterintuitive when compared to conventional transient absorption spectroscopy, the weak attosecond pulse induces a polarization of the medium, which is then perturbed by the time-delayed NIR pulse. Recent measurements demonstrate the rich variety of information that can be extracted in this regime.},

The observed \textasciitilde{}450-attosecond step rise time provides an upper limit for the carrier-induced band-gap reduction and the electron-electron scattering time in the conduction band. This electronic response is separated from the subsequent band-gap modifications due to lattice motion, which occurs on a time scale of 60 ± 10 femtoseconds, characteristic of the fastest optical phonon. Quantum dynamical simulations interpret the carrier injection step as light-field–induced electron tunneling.
Watching electrons dart through silicon
The ultimate speed limit in electronic circuitry is set by the motion of the electrons themselves. Schultze et al. applied attosecond spectroscopy to glimpse this motion in a sample of silicon, the semiconducting building block of modern integrated circuits (see the Perspective by Spielmann). The technique distinguished the electron dynamics—which proceed faster than a quadrillionth of a second after laser excitation—from the comparatively slower lattice motion of the silicon atomic nuclei.

Individual quantum beats of the wavepacket are detected by perturbing the induced polarization of the medium with a time-delayed few-femtosecond near-infrared (NIR) pulse via coupling the individual states to multiple neighboring levels. All of the initially excited states are monitored simultaneously in the attosecond transient absorption spectrum, revealing Lorentzian to Fano lineshape spectral changes as well as quantum beats. The most prominent beating of the several that were observed was in the spin–orbit split 3d absorption features, which has a 40 femtosecond period that corresponds to the spin–orbit splitting of 0.1 eV. The few-level models and multilevel calculations confirm that the observed magnitude of oscillation depends strongly on the spectral bandwidth and tuning of the NIR pulse and on the location of possible coupling states.},

In this investigation, photoemission spectroscopy, in conjunction with femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses, is used to investigate the electronic structure and ultrafast charge carrier dynamics at a Si(100) surface decorated with Zn clusters. Static photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the changes in the electronic structure as the dimensionality of the Zn is increased from small clusters composed of a very few atoms to metallic Zn particles. Furthermore, femtosecond optical-pump XUV-probe photoemission spectroscopy is employed to induce a charge transfer from the p-Si(100) substrate to the Zn clusters and to measure in real time the charge trapping at the Zn cluster as well as the subsequent charge relaxation. The ultrafast charge carrier dynamics are also investigated for small clusters and metallic Zn particles. Significant transient charging of the Zn clusters after excitation of the Si(100) substrate by 800 nm light is observed for Zn coverages greater than 0.12 ML Zn, which coincides with the formation of a Schottky barrier at the interface between the Zn particle and the p-Si(100) substrate. The transient signals show that the charge trapping time at the Zn cluster varies with the cluster size, which is rationalized based on the electronic structure of the cluster as well as the band energy alignment at the Zn cluster–Si(100) junction.},

  abstract = {Within this work, electron dynamics in atoms are experimentally and numerically investigated on their natural attosecond time scales. To access these dynamics, ultrashort and moderately-intense few-cycle laser pulses are superposed with attosecond pulsed radiation in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral region. Both these sources are combined in a new experimental vacuum setup which was designed and built up from scratch, also in order to generate the attosecond pulses. Novel experimental schemes are developed which involve the temporal and spectral interferometric utilization of both ultrashort light sources and include the multidimensional spectroscopy employing different dynamical parameters. These are the intensity and the carrier-envelope phase of the laser pulses, as well as their temporal delay with respect to the attosecond pulses. Scientifically, the observation and control of the quantum-motion of bound electrons, as well as the laser-driven quasi-classical motion of free electrons was a key goal of this work. In particular, a bound two-electron wave packet in helium on attosecond time scales was experimentally observed for the first time. This was realized by combining unprecedented high temporal and spectral resolution. In addition, a new coupling mechanism of several doubly-excited states to an effective single-electron continuum is identified and analyzed. Both these two-electron states as well as single-electron states are interferometrically investigated with access to the phase of their quantum-mechanical wave function. This allows the observation and control of the quantum dynamics of two correlated electrons in atoms on the attosecond time scale which was demonstrated within the scope of this work.},

At the same time, as the harmonic orders increase, the extreme points on the curve of coherence degree vs. carrier-envelope phase shift toward the direction of carrier-envelope phase increasing. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the ionization induced frequency chirp plays an important role in the Carrier-Envelope Phase Effects on the Spatial Coherence.

  abstract = {Attosecond transient absorption is one of the promising new techniques being developed to exploit the availability of sub-femtosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses to study the dynamics of the electron on its natural time scale. The temporal resolution in a transient absorption setup comes from the control of the relative delay and coherence between pump and probe pulses, while the spectral resolution comes from the characteristic width of the features that are being probed. In this review we focus on transient absorption scenarios where an attosecond pulse of XUV radiation creates a broadband excitation that is subsequently probed by a few cycle infrared (IR) laser. Because the attosecond XUV pulses are locked to the IR field cycle, the exchange of energy in the laser–matter interaction can be studied with unprecedented precision. We focus on the transient absorption by helium atoms of XUV radiation around the first ionization threshold, where we can simultaneoulsy solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the single atom response and the Maxwell wave equation for the collective response of the nonlinear medium. We use a time-domain method that allows us to treat on an equal footing all the different linear and nonlinear processes by which the medium can exchange energy with the fields. We present several simple models, based on a few-level system interacting with a strong IR field, to explain many of the novel features found in attosecond transient absorption spectrograms. These include the presence of light-induced states, which demonstrate the ability to probe the dressed states of the atom. We also present a time-domain interpretation of the resonant pulse propagation features that appear in absorption spectra in dense, macroscopic media. We close by reviewing several recent experimental results that can be explained in terms of the models we discuss. Our aim is to present a road map for understanding future attosecond transient absorption experiments in more complex systems.},

  abstract = {Synchrotron-radiation excited ion mass spectrometry has been used to study the 3s3p6np(n≥4) resonances in argon at 25.0–29.3 eV. It is shown using a time-independent resonant scattering approach that the Fano parametrization may be applied to overlapping resonances. For the Dubau-Seaton profile an exact expression of the closed-channel phase shift is obtained. We find that regarding the window character of the Ar 3s series the Fano parameters calculated using the multichannel multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method are in good agreement with those derived from fitting a convoluted Fano function to the measured n=4 autoionizing resonance. The Fano parameters are also derived from perfect fits to the 5≤n≤8 resonances which tests the validity of this parametrization to overlapping members of an inner-valence electron resonance series. In contrast, a parametrization of the entire series based upon the Dubau-Seaton formula did not result in a good fit without modifications. Using the same value of the shape parameter we find, however, that the n=4 resonance can be accurately represented by both the Fano and Dubau-Seaton profiles.},

  abstract = {We report a method to generate phase-only diffractive beam splitters allowing asymmetry of the target diffracted orders, as well as providing a tailored phase difference between the diffracted orders. We apply a well-established design method that requires the determination of a set of numerical parameters, and avoids the use of image iterative algorithms. As a result, a phase lookup table is determined that can be used for any situation where a first-order (blazed) diffractive element is modified to produce higher orders with desired intensity and/or phase relation. As examples, we demonstrate the phase difference control on triplicators, as well as on other generalized diffractive elements like bifocal Fresnel lenses and phase masks for the generation of vortex beams. Results are experimentally demonstrated by encoding the calculated phase pattern onto parallel-aligned liquid crystal spatial light modulators.},
