\begin{acknowledgments}

First of all, I would like to thank both my advisor and my emeritus advisor, Lou DiMauro and Pierre Agostini, for all of their support throughout my time in graduate school. I have gotten to work with a wonderful cast of characters during my time in graduate school, and I wouldn't be where I am today without them.

I'd particularly like to acknowledge the friends that I have made while in graduate school: Thuc Mai, Tim Gorman, Alex Dyhdalo, Steve Tjung, Matt Sheffield, Solani Harawa, and Greg Smith.  I truly cherish the time that we have spent together, and I couldn't have asked for a better friend group.  I truly appreciate your friendship, and I know that graduate school would have been a worse experience without you.

I would also like to that the members of the group that have helped me along the way: Dietrich Kiesewetter, Antoine Camper, Hyunwook Park, Yu Hang Lai, Sha Li, Cosmin Blaga, Kent Talbert, Eric Moore, Kaikai Xhang, Junliang Xu, Abraham Camacho, Sierra O'Bryan, Andrew Piper, Daniel Tuthill, Tim Scarborough, Zhou Wang, Yagou Tang, and Stephen Schoun.  Each and every person in the group has provided invaluable help to me as I navigated my way through research.

I wouldn't have made it through graduate school without the help of machinists Mike Graham and Pete Gosser.  They are truly the ones who deserve credit for the TABLe.  They went above and beyond to help Greg and myself when we were designing it, and it was awesome to work with them on such a large project.

It is important that I acknowledge the contributions of my parents and my sister: Jim, Beth, and Jennifer Hageman.  They have provided endless support to me, and they have helped shape the person I am today.  They have always encouraged me to follow my passions, and I will be eternally grateful for that.

I would also like to thank Wallace and Ricky Hageman.  They have been by my side throughout graduate school, and they have always been there when I needed some support. They inspired some of the acronyms used throughout this dissertation.

Finally, I would like to thank Rileigh.  Without graduate school, I wouldn't have met her, and without her, graduate school wouldn't have been the same.  Her belief in me helped carry me through some dark days, and I am eternally grateful that she is by my side.


%I would like to thank Sir Rickenabcker First of His Name, Last of His Kind, for his eternal indifference.
